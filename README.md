# Draekz ComfyUI Nodez

This is a set of nodes written by me (and some adapted from others, see mentions) to help out in the creation of workflows in ComfyUI for image and video generation. This set of tools will be evolving and is really early on in my learning of the ComfyUI tools and workflows. More to come here.

These will be installed automatically in the set of nodes when using my ComfyUI Ultimate Installer found here:

Licenses for their open source projects is included in the license files, and I have noted all of the files that have been adapted from their code. The rest of the code is released under the main license.
